Part 1 of "Python for Everybody" is titled "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)." 
This part serves as the introduction to programming using the Python language. 
It covers fundamental and basic concepts including terminology and provides a solid foundation for those who are new to programming. 
Below I’ve listed what I think are the main takeaways as well as some additional points that include terminology. 
I chose to omit some parts such as knowing the names of computer components such as CPU and I have also omitted basic procedures such as installing Python.

Main Points
1. Syntax and Semantics:
-	Syntax refers to the structure and rules of a programming language.
  •	Proper indentation is important in Python to define blocks of code.
  •	Parentheses are used to group expressions or function arguments.
  •	Quotation marks are used to denote strings.
-	Semantics refers to the meaning and interpretation of the code.
  •	Understanding error messages helps identify and fix issues in the code.
  •	Following the correct syntax ensures that the code behaves as intended.

Example Code
x = 5  # Correct assignment statement
if x > 10:  # Correct usage of if statement
    print("Greater than 10")
else:
    print("Less than or equal to 10")
print(x)  # Correct usage of print function

2. Procedural Programming:
- Procedural programming is a programming paradigm where a program is structured as a series of sequential steps.
•	In Part 1, learners work with code that is executed in a top-down manner, with each instruction being processed one after another.
•	This approach helps learners understand the flow and structure of a program.
Example Code
x = 5
y = 2
z = x + y  # Sequential execution of addition operation
print(z)  # Output: 7

Key Terminology
1. Variables:
   - Variables are used to store data in Python programs.
   - To assign a value to a variable, the syntax is: `variable_name = value`.
   - Variables can store different types of data, such as numbers, strings (text), and boolean values (True or False).
   - Example: `x = 5` assigns the value 5 to the variable `x`.

2. Expressions:
   - Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that can be evaluated to produce a result.
   - Arithmetic operators in Python include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), floor division (//), and modulo (%).
   - Expressions can be as simple as performing arithmetic operations or can involve more complex calculations.
   - Example: `result = 2 * (3 + 4)` assigns the value 14 to the variable `result` by evaluating the expression.

3. Conditional Execution:
   - Conditional statements allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.
   - The `if` statement checks if a condition is True and executes a block of code if the condition is met.
   - The `else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition in the `if` statement is False.
   - The `elif` statement allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.
Example Code
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

4. Functions:
   - Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
   - Functions can take input arguments, perform operations, and return output values.
   - Functions help organize code and promote code reusability.
Example Code:
def add_numbers(a, b):
    sum = a + b
    return sum
result = add_numbers(3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 7
